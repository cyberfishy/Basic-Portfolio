		<p>Being married to Mary Ann Clayton for 49 years is my greatest asset. I'm a husband, father, and grandfather. </p>
		<p>As a graduate of Brigham Young University in Art, and also a graduate of many shorter programs mostly in User Experience Design and front-end web technologies, I have been employed, usually as a contractor, by huge and small firms, usually for fairly short periods of time -- that seems to be the way it's done in this industry. I've worked for Wells Fargo Bank, WAMU Bank (now defunct -- NOT my fault!), Sony, Hewlett-Packard (HP), Fidelity, Pacific Life, Fedex, California Court System, County of San Diego, and many others.</p>
		<p>Many awards for computer graphics, graphic design, and for UX Design have been heaped upon me.</p>
		<p>The Sierra is awesome for hiking and camping, the sky is amazing for flying airplanes (I'm a licensed Private Pilot, single-engine land, with sailplane), and I take pictures. I paint and sculpt and draw in both digital and analog mediums.</p>
		<p>Professional photography was a major part of my livlihood for 20 years while I was also doing advertising and design for Sanyo Mainframe computers, Voit Sporting Goods, Teal Industries, Gradco, Toshiba, Microsoft, PWC and many others.</p>
		<p>I am an early-adapter and love to possess the latest technology, so I purchased the first electronic handheld calculator I ever saw even though it was about the cost of several months rent (1971), and could only add, subtract, multiply, and divide on eight digits maximum capacity.</p>
